# Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots
<b><i>Social Network Analysis of Disinformation/Influence Operations and Bots</i> Cross-Platforms on <i>Amber Heard</i>. 
<br>Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Instagram, Change.org, and Facebook for <i>6 Social Media Platforms</i>.</b>

#### <i><b>Millions of Texts and Millions of Accounts were studied for Social Network Analysis.</b></i>

We're Worldwide Independent Researchers with over 20 data analysts, scientists, and observers analyzing this data for over a year. Research and development is ongoing, and this public operation spanning for years continues. We invite researchers, an ethical public, and students to study this public case example. 

#### <i><b>Data collected on Amber Heard is primarily related to the years 2018-2021, ongoing into 2022.</b></i>

This is the most detailed public analysis of a disinformation operation and the most voluminous yet - showing the impact of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-breakout-scale-measuring-the-impact-of-influence-operations"><i>Category 6</a> influence,</b></i> globally affecting the public, businesses, nonprofits, reporters, social connections, well-being and entities beyond the victim, Amber Heard. 
<br>This dynamic project is in-progress, prepared for review, and ready to be built upon.  

<b>Our Study creates Precedents and Foundations to help victims of cyberabuse, bots, domestic abuse, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a>, hostile environments, and Disinformation Operations to Improve Lives.</b> 
<br>We want to save lives and help partners create systems to help online - e.g., specialized and accurate rescue, quality custom studies, data analysis, Social Network Analysis, forensics, research, situation awareness, data science projects, prevention, and rescue/public safety technologies - <i>with focus on the victim primarily and <b>her environment</b></i>.

### <b>Collaboration:</b> 
If you're a humanitarian, researcher, social enterprise, organization, student, or academic helping female victims of abuse, coercive control, domestic abuse, bots, operations, violence, harassment, or hostile environments - we welcome collaboration with you.
<br>Our studies and data can be used for Social Network Analysis, Data Analysis, machine learning, Natural Language Processing, artificial intelligence, Data Science labeling, anti-abuse, rescue projects, anti-crime, timelines, OSINT, simulations, and monitoring systems to help other victims and their lives. 
<br><br>Since this data is high volume about domestic abuse and gender, with an actress/model and film industry element, it's highly relevant for classification and data science projects on those topics.
<br><i>Please contact us for collaboration or if with questions on obtaining more data and code.</i>
<br><br>
<b>Although it's abuse of process, <a href="https://www.connecticutprotectivemoms.org/coercive-control-legislation-in-the">coercive control</a> is becoming illegal in more countries and states/provinces worldwide.</b> 
<br>To this degree, severity, and volume of intimidation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion">extortion</a> is already illegal.
- <i>If you're a victim needing help against cyberabuse especially in <a href="https://safeescape.org">online domestic abuse</a>, operations, and <a href="https://metta-space.com">hostile environments</a>, please contact us.</i><br>

#### <b>Do No Harm:</b>
All collaborators, researchers, and observers are required to sign, acknowledge, agree to "Do No Harm" agreements. If you are one of the victims, businesses, nonprofits, or entities listed in this study and want to collaborate with us, please contact us.
<br><br>We make this study and data fully open to <a href="https://www.teamscopeapp.com/blog/6-repositories-to-share-your-research-data">Public Research</a>. We do not include the full code, however, we make data open on data repositories to protect the individual in this study, to make a long-lasting impact for learning in the scientific world, and to prevent harmful operations. As a precedent, other researchers and students should use this GitHub and study as a basis for their own social network analysis projects. 
<br>We draw attention to this project months before in-person appearances for safety.

### <b>Public Research:</b>
This Independent Study is open for Public Research, scientific learning, and archiving.
<br><b>Full Data</b> is on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/amberhearddata/datasets">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GjKdNpsJSBIX9MsQgKq2FGTArDVEYFFI?usp=sharing">Google</a>, Archives, and research data repositories.
- <i>"Research data can save lives, help develop solutions and maximise our knowledge. Promoting collaboration and cooperation among a global research community is the first step to reduce the burden of wasted research."</i>
- "When researchers make their data public, they increase transparency and trust in their work, they enable others to reproduce and validate their findings, and ultimately, contribute to the pace of scientific discovery by allowing others to reuse and build on top of their data."

<b>Across-Platforms Analysis:</b><br>
Analysis is in-progress across-platforms, <b>going beyond any previous public studies</b>. 

- <i>Data of 5 months of December 2020 to April 2021 is provided on GitHub for open peer-review and research studies. Full Data for more independent cross-platform analysis is provided in research data repositories.</i>
- <i> Note:</i> Peaks, Heat Maps of Threats, coordinated bot activities, repeated same texts, and more anomalies show for 2018-2022 continuing, especially February 2020 onward as seen in analysis files.
<br>Not all analysis is given for researcher privacy for published research papers and review of the operations.

### <b>Threat Analysis of "High Risk" Influence:</b><br>
- <b><i>We show increases of threats and escalations - even in spite of her winning in cases or gaps of announcements.</b></i>
- Threat analysis and our studies shows the timelines to escalations of risks with keywords, phrases use. Hundreds of thousands of threatening texts exist against Amber Heard on 6 platforms. In social dynamics, within automated simulations caused by services are percentages of incited people to harm. In examples, within tens of thousands of repeated same texts on YouTube (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/Adapt%20and%20Survive%20Amber%20Heard%20-%20YouTube%20Video">"Adapt and Survive"</a>), false interactions on all platforms, and cryptic bot networks are people brought into them to threaten Amber Heard.  
- Experts saw cyber crime and <a href="https://www.iosi.global">suspicious activities needing flagging for removal</a> by cybersecurity. See more in <i>Study Case</i>.
- Clustering analysis with cyber intelligence research reveals scientifically operations to cause distress beyond searching manually. Clustering further shows sports bots networks, movie networks, and 506 other clusters around the Aquaman petition, nonsense mentions, and astroturfing e.g., Reddit NLP sandbox.
- Multiple layers of companies, services, are likely. Along with the case's circumstances of intimidation, violence, missing people, high wealth of opposition, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/LegalCenter/story?id=1625097&page=1">Hollywood Fixers</a>, and suspicious activities, the online world similarly has been made threatening to exploit the <a href="https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids">Data Void</a>. 
<br><i>"Data voids are not unique to search engines; they occur on social media platforms, too."</i>

<b>Origins, Risks, Situation, and Private Sector Operations:</b>
- After reviewing analysis and data quantifications, explanations of origins and motive can be discovered. 
<br>Folder <i><a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/-%20Study%20Case%20-%20Effects%2C%20Risks%2C%20Origins">'Study Case - Effects, Risks, Origins'</a></i> shows dangerous Private Sector operations. 
- <a href="https://github.com/RescueSocialTech/Amber-Heard_Disinformation_Operations_Bots/tree/main/Subjective%20Preliminary%20Claims">'Subjective Preliminary Claims'</a> sources explanations to layers of services, companies, decades of fixers, coercive control, social media building, insider threats, and malice where extortion using cyber activities can come from.
